## 📌 Problem Statement

Students frequently lose personal belongings such as ID cards, water bottles, books, and electronics on campus.  
Traditional lost & found systems are often:
- Manual and offline  
- Hard to search  
- Poorly organized  
- Not accessible to everyone  

This leads to unnecessary delays and permanent loss of items.
